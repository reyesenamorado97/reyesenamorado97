  <div>
    <h4>
        I am a senior computer science student at the University at Buffalo and will be graduating in Spring 2024. Designing the frontend and backend of websites or mobile applications is where I have the most fun. New challenges excite and bring the best out of me, as I'm always looking for new ways to grow as a software engineer.
